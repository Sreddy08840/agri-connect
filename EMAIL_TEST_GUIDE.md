# Email Confirmation System - Quick Test Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### Option 1: Console Mode (No Email Setup Required)

The system works immediately without any email configuration. Emails will be logged to console.

1. **Start the API server:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/api
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Place a test order** via the web interface or API

3. **Check console output** for email details:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Email service not configured. Emails will be logged to console only.
   
   üìß Email (Console Mode):
   To: customer@example.com
   Subject: Order Confirmation - ORD-1234567890
   Body: <!DOCTYPE html>...
   ```

### Option 2: Real Email Testing (Gmail)

1. **Create/Use Gmail Account** with 2FA enabled

2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification
   - Go to App Passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Create `.env` file** in `packages/api/`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Add Email Configuration** to `.env`:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-char-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
   ```

5. **Restart API Server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

6. **Verify Initialization:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Email service initialized successfully
   ```

7. **Place Test Order** and check:
   - Console logs: `‚úÖ Email sent successfully: <message-id>`
   - Email inbox for confirmation emails

  }
}
```
