# üîß Mobile App Fixes Applied

## üìã Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Blank White Screen Issue
**Problem**: App was showing a blank white screen after bundling due to broken API initialization in `app/_layout.tsx`.

**Root Cause**:
- `_layout.tsx` was importing a non-existent `apiPromise` export
- App was stuck waiting for an undefined promise
- Duplicate `plugins` entries in `app.json` was causing configuration errors

**Fixes Applied**:
- Simplified `app/_layout.tsx` to remove broken API initialization
- Removed duplicate `plugins` configuration in `app.json`
- Optimized API URL detection in `utils/constants.ts` to use configured URL immediately

### 2. ‚úÖ Image Upload Feature Enabled
**Problem**: Image picker was disabled and showing placeholder alerts.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### a) **Configuration (`app.json`)**:
- ‚úÖ Added `expo-image-picker` plugin configuration
- ‚úÖ Added iOS permissions (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSCameraUsageDescription)
- ‚úÖ Added Android permissions (CAMERA, READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate plugins entries

#### b) **Product Add Screen (`app/farmer/product-add.tsx`)**:
- ‚úÖ Enabled `expo-image-picker` import
- ‚úÖ Implemented `pickImage()` function for gallery selection
- ‚úÖ Implemented `takePhoto()` function for camera capture
- ‚úÖ Implemented `uploadImages()` function with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript errors with upload service integration
- ‚úÖ Added permission requests on component mount
- ‚úÖ Updated UI text from "temporarily disabled" to helpful hints

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed API Service Duplication
**Problem**: `services/api.ts` had duplicate `export const api` declarations.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate export, kept single API instance.

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd packages/api
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Start Mobile App

#### Option A: USB Connection (Recommended)
```bash
cd apps/mobile
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
pnpm start
# Press 'a' for Android
```

#### Option B: Tunnel Mode (Works Anywhere)
```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm start:tunnel
# Scan QR code in Expo Go app
```

#### Option C: LAN Mode (Same WiFi)
```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm start:lan
# Scan QR code in Expo Go app
```

### 3. Test Image Upload
1. Login as a farmer
2. Navigate to "Add Product"
3. Tap "Gallery" or "Camera" button
4. Select/take a photo
5. Photo should appear in the preview
6. Fill in product details
7. Submit - images will upload to backend

---

## ‚ú® Features Now Working

- ‚úÖ App loads and shows login screen
- ‚úÖ Pick images from gallery
- ‚úÖ Take photos with camera
- ‚úÖ Preview selected images
- ‚úÖ Remove selected images
- ‚úÖ Upload up to 5 images per product
- ‚úÖ Images upload to backend before creating product
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for failed uploads
- ‚úÖ Permission requests on first use

---

## üîç Technical Details

### Image Upload Flow
1. User selects image from gallery or camera
2. Image is captured with base64 encoding
3. Image preview shown locally using URI
4. On submit, base64 is sent to `uploadProductImage()` API
5. API returns image URL from server
6. Product is created with array of image URLs

### Type Safety
- Fixed all TypeScript errors
- Proper handling of nullable base64 strings
- Correct return types for upload service
- Type-safe image state management

### Error Handling
- Permission denied alerts
- Upload failure handling
- Validation before submission
- User-friendly error messages

## üìù Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Image Compression**: Add image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth
2. **Progress Indicator**: Show upload progress for each image
3. **Image Cropping**: Add image cropping/editing before upload
4. **Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanism for failed uploads
5. **Offline Support**: Cache images and retry upload when online

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Permissions**: App will request camera and photo permissions on first use
2. **Backend Required**: Backend must be running for image uploads to work
3. **Network**: Device must be able to reach backend API (use tunnel mode if on different networks)
4. **Base64 Size**: Large images may take time to upload; consider adding compression

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ All critical issues fixed. App is now fully functional with image upload capability!
